# ADR-0003: Site Mapping

## Status

accepted

## Context

The site map structure was something that I was having difficulty coming up with, due to the constraints mentioned in 0001 and 0002. The site forking was the issue, it was either one long page or multiple different pages. The first was better for 0002, but the second decision was better for 0001. 

## Decision

We will be using a multi-paged structure, shared by a nav bar with at least 3-4 different pages linked to it.

## Alternatives Considered

We could have gone to a single page layout, but that wasn't the best idea just because of the level of detail that we were going to be storing on other parts of the pages. 

One of the other ideas was that we could have been using some form of hybrid, but I was unsure about my level of skill accomplishing that efficiently, and it would not have been great for structure either.

## Consequences

The good part is that this keeps the site from being too bulky on first pass, and keeps the homepage clean.

The bad part is that this is still going to take lots of repetition and work that normally with a regular site building framework, it would not be as big of an issue.

# Note: 

The repetition has known fixes for HTML and whatnot, but I am not using those currently just to make sure the architecture is clean.
